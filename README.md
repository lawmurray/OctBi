OctBi
=====

OctBi is a package for GNU Octave with functions for plotting the outputs of LibBi ([www.libbi.org](http://www.libbi.org)). It is not a complete environment for calling LibBi from within Octave, however.

OctBi should also work with MATLAB, but has not been thoroughly tested with it as yet. If you do find problems, you are encouraged to fix them and contribute back to the project.


Installation
------------

To install, place the `OctBi/` directory anywhere you please. Start Octave and type the following command:

    addpath('/path/to/OctBi/inst');

You can also add this command to the `.octaverc` file in your home directory, to avoid having to enter it each time you start Octave.


Usage
-----

Most of the OctBi commands are prefixed by `bi_`, so type this and hit tab to see what is available, and use the `help` command to find out more.
